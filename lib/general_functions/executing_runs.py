    model_folder: string

        Directory to the executable that should be linked to in the batch file

        Name of the batch script that should be generated. Defaults to "run_model.bat"
    
    include_cd: Boolean (Optional)
        Controls if a "cd {model directory}" statement is included in the batch file.

    batch_file_folder: string (Optional)
        Input a directory that should hold the batch file. This overrides including the file inside of the model folder
